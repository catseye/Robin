;'<<SPEC'

    -> Tests for functionality "Evaluate Robin Expression (with List)"

`empty?` evaluates its single argument, and evaluates to `#t` if that value
is the empty list, `#f` otherwise.

    |   (empty? (literal symbol))
    = #f

    |   (empty? ())
    = #t

    |   (empty? (list 1 2 3))
    = #f

'<<SPEC'

(define empty? (fun (li)
  (equal? li ())))
