    -> Tests for functionality "Execute Robin Program (with List)"

`empty?` evaluates its single argument, and evaluates to `#t` if that value
is the empty list, `#f` otherwise.

    | (display
    |   (empty? (literal symbol)))
    = #f

    | (display
    |   (empty? ()))
    = #t

    | (display
    |   (empty? (list 1 2 3)))
    = #f

(define empty? (fun (li)
  (equal? li ())))
