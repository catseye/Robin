### `head` ###

    -> Tests for functionality "Interpret core Robin Program"

`head` evaluates its argument to a list, and evaluates to the first element
of that list.

    | (display
    |   (head (prepend #t ())))
    = #t

`head` expects exactly one argument, and expects it to be a list.
If these conditions are not met, the behaviour is undefined.

`head` is basically equivalent to Scheme's `car`.
