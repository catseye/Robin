    -> Tests for functionality "Evaluate Robin Expression (with Small)"

One of the most basic identifiers available in `small` is `literal`,
which evaluates to the literal content of its sole argument, which can be
any S-expression.

    | (literal symbol))
    = symbol

    | (literal (hello (there) world)))
    = (hello (there) world)

`literal` requires at least one argument; otherwise, an exception will
be raised.

    | (literal)
    ? uncaught exception

Any arguments beyond the first argument are simply ignored and discarded.

    | (literal a b c))
    = a

`literal` is basically equivalent to Scheme's `quote`.
