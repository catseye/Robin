    -> Tests for functionality "Evaluate Robin Expression (with List)"

`extend` evaluates its first two arguments to values of any type, and its
third argument to obtain an alist.  It returns a new alist which
associates the first two values in a new pair.  The new pair shadows
any existing pairs with the same key that may already be in the alist.

    | (extend (literal b) 6 (literal ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3))))
    = ((b 6) (a 1) (b 2) (c 3))

The following should be true for any identifier i and alist x.

    | (let ((i (literal a))
    |       (x (literal ((f 5) (g 7)))))
    |   (lookup i (extend i 1 x)))
    = (1)

    | (extend (literal b) 6 ())
    = ((b 6))

    | (extend (literal b) 6 81)
    ? abort (expected-list 81)
