    -> Tests for functionality "Evaluate Robin Expression (with List)"

`reverse` evaluates its argument to a list, then evaluates to a list which
is the same as the given list in every respect except that the order of
the elements is reversed.

    |   (reverse (literal (1 2 3 4 5)))
    = (5 4 3 2 1)

    |   (reverse (literal fairies-wear-boots))
    ? abort (expected-list fairies-wear-boots)

'<<SPEC'
(define reverse (fun (li)
  (fold prepend () li)))
