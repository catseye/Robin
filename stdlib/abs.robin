    -> Tests for functionality "Evaluate Robin Expression (with Arith)"

`abs` evaluates its single argument to a number, and evaluates to
the absolute value of that number (where the sign is always positive.)

    |   (abs 5)
    = 5

    |   (abs (subtract 0 5))
    = 5

    |   (abs 0)
    = 0

`abs` expects exactly one numeric argument.

    |   (abs)
    ? uncaught exception: (illegal-arguments ())

    |   (abs 14 23)
    ? uncaught exception: (illegal-arguments (14 23))

    |   (abs #t)
    ? uncaught exception: (expected-number #t)
