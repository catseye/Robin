(some of these are possibly long-term plans)

A way to evaluate a Robin expression and display it, mainly
to make the tests more concise - don't need to say `(display ...)` always.

Make the Javascript version display all errors.

Environments as abstract maps, alist->env, env->alist

Values of "opaque" type, to support that.

Rename `fun` to `function`.

Rename `raise` to `throw`.
