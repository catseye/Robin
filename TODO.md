TODO
====

Long-term
---------

Environments as abstract maps, alist->env, env->alist

Values of "opaque" type, to support that.

Maybe
-----

Intrinsics documented in otherwise empty files in stdlib?

Evaluate a Robin expression and display it? REPL?

Bring together the docs into a single large spec?

Rename `raise` to `throw`?
