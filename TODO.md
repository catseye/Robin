TODO
====

Test that circular definitions are not allowed.

Move all the tests to the bottom (or the top?) of each defining file.

Long-term
---------

Environments as abstract maps, alist->env, env->alist

Values of "opaque" type, to support that.

Top-level: `assert`, `requires` (sugar for a form of `assert`).

Maybe
-----

Evaluate a Robin expression and display it? REPL?

Bring together the docs into a single large spec?

Rename `raise` to `throw`?
